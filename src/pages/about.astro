        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        gap: 1em;

<BaseLayout title={title}>
    <main>
        <h2>Elise has made a custom starter!</h2>

        <p>This builds upon the starter (generic) that comes with <code>astro init</code> and adds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A base layout with the basic page structure</li>
            <li>A base head with all the minimal required head elements</li>
            <li>A title prop that can be set on any page and has a default that can be set in the base layout</li>
        </ul>
    </main>
    <Tour />

           - You can also use imported framework components directly in your markup!
           -
           - Note: by default, these components are NOT interactive on the client.
           - The `:visible` directive tells Astro to make it interactive.
